# Pacman

This project is a **fan-made remake** of the classic arcade game **Pac-Man**, originally developed by **Namco** (now part of Bandai Namco Entertainment). It was created for **educational and non-commercial purposes**, with the goal of exploring classic game mechanics, AI behavior, and level design.
